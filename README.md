# Book Recommendation System ðŸ“—ðŸ“˜ðŸ“™ðŸ“•ðŸ§©

I have developed a Flask-based book recommendation system that uses data of Books, Ratings, and Users and after being processed it predicts similarity between others

## Collaborative Recommendation System âœ¨

In this, I have used a collaborative technique that predicts on the basis of past users' behaviors

## Content Base System âœ¨

This technique uses the attributes of items in order to make recommendations.

## Hybrid Approach System âœ¨

This technique uses both collaborative and content base approach to recommend.
